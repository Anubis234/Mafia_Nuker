# Mafia_Nuker
The tool you're describing seems to be a **Discord server management tool** that automates various administrative actions, including server nuking and member management. Based on the actions listed in your code (e.g., Nuke Server, Spam Messages, Ban All Members, Role Spam, etc.), this tool seems like a **Discord nuking tool** designed to automate destructive actions in a Discord server. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each action would typically involve:

1. **Nuke Server**: This would delete all content in the server, including messages, channels, roles, and other settings, essentially wiping the server clean.
2. **Spam Messages**: Sends a large number of messages to one or more channels in the server, potentially spamming the chat.
3. **Kick All Members**: Kicks all members from the server, effectively removing them from the server.
4. **Ban All Members**: Bans all members in the server, preventing them from rejoining.
5. **Role Spam**: Assigns roles to users in a spammy manner, possibly affecting server settings and user permissions.
6. **Emoji Delete**: Deletes all emojis in the server.
7. **DM All Members**: Sends a direct message (DM) to all members in the server, often used for spamming.
8. **Grant Admin**: Gives all members admin permissions, potentially leading to misuse.
9. **Delete All Channels**: Deletes all text and voice channels in the server.
10. **Spam Webhook**: Spams messages through a Discord webhook, flooding the channel with unwanted messages.
11. **Spam Emoji**: Adds multiple emojis to the server in a spammy manner.
12. **All Actions**: Executes all of the above actions at once, fully nuking and destroying the server.

### What Can Perform These Actions

These types of tools are typically referred to as **Discord Nukers** or **Discord Raid Tools**. They are used to disrupt or destroy Discord servers by executing various destructive actions at once. However, it's important to note that these tools often violate Discord's Terms of Service, as they are designed to cause damage or spam a server, which can lead to the tool's creator or user being banned from Discord.

### Ethical Considerations and Legal Issues
- **Usage**: These tools should only be used on servers where you have explicit permission to manage and take action (e.g., server admins or owners who want to reset or test server features).
- **Abuse**: Misuse of such tools, especially in public or private servers without consent, is unethical and against Discord's Terms of Service. It may lead to account bans or other legal actions.
  
### Warning: It's critical to use such tools responsibly and ensure you have permission to perform these actions in the targeted server. Misuse of such tools could result in legal repercussions and bans from platforms like Discord.
